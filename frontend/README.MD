# Welcome to Vikesplace Frontend!

## Run the App

### 1. Open Docker Hub Desktop

### 2. Run `docker-compose up` in Project Directory

Note: Project Directory is \vikesplace\frontend\

This will take approximately 2 minutes to run. Once complete, the frontend application is running on a docker container.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## Available Scripts

_(Modifed from Create React App default README.MD)_

In the project directory (\vikesplace\frontend\\), you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

If you would like to run the application this way, you will need to run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are available.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

Do not run this command! It allows for customized development with configuration files and transitive dependencies, but we do not intend to use it at this time.
